  <h1>Interview in <i>Burning Worlds</i></h1>
  <h2>February 22, 2018</h2>
  <p>I had the pleasure of being interviewed by Amy Brady, the brilliant senior editor of the Chicago Review of Books, for her monthly column <i>Burning Worlds: Climate Change in Art and Literature</i>. Read the full interview <a href = 'http://mailchi.mp/3edc52ea40c2/burning-worlds-climate-change-in-art-and-literature-140345?e=8d2bc7da78' target = '_blank'>here.</a>
    <p><b>Excerpt</b></p>
  <p><b>Amy</b>: What strikes me most about your work is that you are always exploring the relationship between the human and the natural world. What are the challenges of this relationship, and why do we have such a hard time figuring out how to have a healthy, mutually beneficial relationship with the natural world?</p>

  <p><b>Andres</b>: Humans have always had an intimate connection to the climate. Twenty thousand years ago, North America was covered in a massive ice sheet. The first agrarian societies emerged only after the ice sheet melted and sea levels stabilized. Humans basically found their niche in a stable, de-glaciated climate. To this day, we remain heavily reliant on this climate, but that carefully balanced relationship has largely been overshadowed by capital and by the effects of globalism. So, one of the things I'm really worried about with climate change is not only the effects it can have on sea levels and global inequality but its effects on all culture. So much historically has been based on our relationship to Earth. Thatâ€™s something we often forget in our globalized world.</p>
