  <h1 style = 'line-height: 1.3em'>Youth workshop at the Sanctuary for Independent Media</h1>
  <h2>September 13, 2018</h2>
  <p>I'm so happy to have been invited to give a workshop as part of the <a href = 'https://www.mediasanctuary.org/' target = '_blank'>Sanctuary for Independent Media</a>'s youth empowerment program, <a href = 'https://www.mediasanctuary.org/news/event-recap/us18/'>Uptown Summer</a>! The five-week program brought eight youth employees together to investigate environmental justice issues in North Central Troy. Youth employees had the opportunity to work with mentors and experts from diverse fields and ultimately develop their own projects to drive change within their community.
  </p>
  <p>My workshop, <a href = 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaedc498d4UUzqnAtuZhO0kmsj2XbZ1RC8hpB9F3edA/edit#heading=h.6s83dhw8q6bz' target = '_blank'><i>the World in Numbers: Storytelling With Climate and Environmental Data</i></a>, centered around a hands-on exercise where participants were challenged to develop a research question related to environmental injustice in Troy and propose a storytelling or campaign approach informed by data. Participants learned how to search for and perform basic analysis on publicly available data, as well as how to collect their own data through polling or environmental monitoring.</p>
  <p>The youth employees came up with amazing ideas, and two of the projects were carried out over the course of the summer! I'm overjoyed to share a few of their projects below:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Felicia and Najayah proposed polling local fishers on their awareness of river quality and whether they eat the fish they catch. For her final project, Felicia produced an informative and immersive radio story on contaminated fish in the Hudson. <a href = 'https://www.mediasanctuary.org/news/uptown-summer-2018-youth-radio-stories/' target = '_blank'>Check out her project here.</a></li>
  <li>Nicolena and Donovan presented data from <a href = 'https://www.riverkeeper.org/water-quality/hudson-river/' target = '_blank'>riverkeeper.org</a> as evidence that the Hudson river is more polluted in Troy than downstream in Albany and even parts of the East River in New York City. They proposed building a notification system into social media that would alert nearby users when river quality is higher or lower than usual.</li>
  <li>Angelo distributed a survery to residents of Troy to collect data on negligent landlords and produced a four-part radio story on the issue. <a href = 'https://www.mediasanctuary.org/news/negligent-landlords-in-troy-a-four-part-radio-series-with-angelo-domingo/' target = '_blank'>Check out the story here.</a><img src = 'images/angelo_survey-1.jpg'/></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Many thanks to Ellie Irons and Branda Miller for inviting me and to Durasia Anderson for participating as a workshop mentor. I'm honored to have been able to help out with such an amazing program, and beyond impressed by the work produced by these talented youths and program volunteers.</p>

  <h1>Interview in <i>Burning Worlds</i></h1>
  <h2>February 22, 2018</h2>
  <p>I had the pleasure of being interviewed by Amy Brady, the brilliant senior editor of the Chicago Review of Books, for her monthly column <i>Burning Worlds: Climate Change in Art and Literature</i>. <a href = 'http://mailchi.mp/3edc52ea40c2/burning-worlds-climate-change-in-art-and-literature-140345?e=8d2bc7da78' target = '_blank'>Read the full interview here.</a>
    <p><b>Excerpt</b></p>
  <p><b>Amy</b>: What strikes me most about your work is that you are always exploring the relationship between the human and the natural world. What are the challenges of this relationship, and why do we have such a hard time figuring out how to have a healthy, mutually beneficial relationship with the natural world?</p>

  <p><b>Andres</b>: Humans have always had an intimate connection to the climate. Twenty thousand years ago, North America was covered in a massive ice sheet. The first agrarian societies emerged only after the ice sheet melted and sea levels stabilized. Humans basically found their niche in a stable, de-glaciated climate. To this day, we remain heavily reliant on this climate, but that carefully balanced relationship has largely been overshadowed by capital and by the effects of globalism. So, one of the things I'm really worried about with climate change is not only the effects it can have on sea levels and global inequality but its effects on all culture. So much historically has been based on our relationship to Earth. Thatâ€™s something we often forget in our globalized world.</p>
