<h1>My top 50 albums of the decade</h1>

<!-- <p>As a music-lover and obsessive keeper of spreadsheets, it was all but inevitable that I would want to produce a "top albums of the decade" list. I've been working on it since Spring 2019, poring through as much familiar and unfamiliar music as possible. In the process, I have enjoyed trips through memory lane and experienced many fantastic albums for the first time.
</p>
<p>Eventually, I settled on the idea of choosing 50 albums, which would be large enough to cover a wide range of artists and sounds, but small enough to be highly discerning. The top ten are ranked (and written up) and the next forty are unranked. Please enjoy :-)</p> -->

      <h1>Kendrick Lamar<i>, To Pimp a Butterfly</i></h1>
      <h2>2015</h2>

      <p><i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> is untouchable, an album of monumental importance and a sonic masterpiece. It embodies a scathing critique of the American narrative of social progress, without sacrificing the deeply personal storytelling and local ties that define Kendrick Lamar as an artist. As in <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i>, Lamar is strikingly honest about his own experience with fame and Blackness, but he is more comfortable harnessing the power of dialogue this time around – for example, inhabiting the voices of a predatory record producer (“Wesley’s Theory”), a beggar (“How Much a Dollar Cost”), and long-time friends (“Institutionalized", “u”). It proves to be a powerful format, especially for such a gifted vocal artist, strengthening the dynamism of the album across sixteen tracks and channeling Lamar's ability to expose the personal impacts of institutionalized racism.</p>

      <p>Yet somehow, Lamar's lyrical craft is matched by its musical counterpart. <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i>, which was executive produced by G-funk pioneer Dr. Dre, features many of the decade's most exciting West Coast jazz artists throughout, including Thundercat, Terrace Martin, Robert Glasper, and Kamasi Washington. The music is dense, but not bloated, dynamic, but not restless; each track a masterclass in balance and composition.</p>

      <p>The album ends with an extended dialogue between Lamar and the late Tupac Shakur. At once heart-wrenching and revelatory: Tupac’s comments are as prescient now as they were in 1994. Toward the end of the conversation, Lamar shares a poem that compares personal growth to the lifecycle of a caterpillar. The caterpillar is forced to consume its surroundings for protection, yet it is shunned until achieving the status of a butterfly, at which point new challenges emerge. For Lamar, fame is not without contradiction, responsibility, and even danger. We should do our best to listen.</p>

      <h1>Julia Holter<i>, Aviary</i></h1>
      <h2>2018</h2>

      <p>Listening to <i>Aviary</i> is a journey, and over the course of its 90-minute runtime, the album will consume you. It is a labrynth, at times chaotic and spectacular. Each performance is expansive: tracks like "Chaitius" and "Everyday is an Emergency," may lure you into the territory of medieval hallucination before shaking you awake to the sound of Holter's own voice. While the first half of the album is dense with instrumentation and almost dizzyingly complex, many songs on the second half of the album like "Colligere" and "Why Sad Song" push Holter's voice forward in the mix and are riff with a more familiar sense of longing, forgiveness, and reflection.</p>

      <p>Holter's vision is well supported by an innovative set of instrumentalists including Tashi Wada, Corey Fogel, and Devin Hoff, whose fearless contributions are captured in a heroic mixing job by Kenny Gillmore (formerly of Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti). Sure, some might consider the album to be esoteric, but <i>Aviary</i> is a daring and singular work of art from one of this decade’s most talented musicians.</p>

    <div class='blurb'>
      <h1>Kanye West, <i>Yeezus</i></h1>
      <h2>2013</h2>
      <p><i>Yeezus</i> finds West at his most inspired, focused, and truly dangerous moment. A thrilling album of serrated noise that is at once frenetically composed and carefully stripped down, <i>Yeezus</i> strikes a rare balance between listenability and experimentalism. It is the product of an intense collaborative process that saw West giving and taking from his peers in equally generous measure. The extent of artistry and innovation is made clear by moments like the children's choir interlude in "On Sight" and the seamless harmonization between West, Chief Keef, and Justin Vernon on Arca-produced "Hold My Liquor."</p>

      <p>Perhaps more surprisingly, <i>Yeezus</i> features West rapping at nearly peak form. His verses on "I Am A God" and "Bound 2" are fantastic, despite it being unclear whether West himself is in on all of the jokes or not. Regardless, <i>Yeezus</i> is an album chock full of surprises that befits West's larger-than-life personality, and it is arguably the greatest achievement of one of the twenty-first century's most inventive and prolific musicians.</p>

    <div class='blurb'>
      <h1>FKA twigs, <i>MAGDALENE</i></h1>
      <h2>2019</h2>
      <p>With <i>MAGDALENE</i>, FKA twigs has produced a deeply personal masterpiece. Working through stages of grief and loneliness in the wake of a highly-publicized break-up, grappling with one’s own body and its frailty before and after undergoing intrusive surgery; twigs does not shy away from vulnerability. Instead, she generously shares each blow, drawing the listener closer than ever before.</p>
      <p>Twigs has suffered through devastating pain, and it shows, but <i>MAGDALENE</i> also illustrates her staggering perseverance. After an outpouring of remorse on stand-out track “home with you” (matched only by album closer “cellophane”), twigs reaches the point of reluctant self-valorization. “holy terrain” and “mary magdalene” speak directly to twigs’ growing acceptance of past injustices and growing love for herself.</p>

      <p>Despite having enlisted a set of expensive producers, it is twigs’ own songwriting and production that shine through. Her vocal modulations on “sad day” echo those of <i>LP1</i> track “Lights On,” while the album’s ballads reflect a much clearer departure from her prior work. Without showing off, twigs demonstrates on various occasions not only creative prowess, but a truly powerful and emotive voice. At times heart-wrenching, but always compelling, <i>MAGDALENE</i> will be treasured for years to come.</p>

    <img src='images/Cloud_Nothings-Attack_on_Memory.jpg'/>
    <div class='blurb'>
      <h1>Cloud Nothings, <i>Attack on Memory</i></h1>
      <h2>2012</h2>
      <p>I'll admit it, Cloud Nothings were one of my first musical obsessions. It was late 2009 when I heard their debut single "Hey Cool Kid" on Sirius XMU's Aquarium Drunkard show and was instantly hooked. I consumed every subsequent release with glee, and their sound – a trebly, lo-fi take on power pop – unsubtly seeped into that of my own band. For the next two years, I tried everything to see them perform in NYC, but they were solidly locked into the 21+ circuit.</p>
      <p>In October 2011, I found my opportunity. They had been booked to play a student lounge at Stevens Institute of Technology, and while I couldn't pass as 21, I could definitely pass as a college freshman. In that show for around 25 people, Cloud Nothings ripped through all of <i>Attack on Memory</i> and none of the music that I loved. Their performance was stunningly intense, but almost entirely unfamiliar: gentle fuzz replaced by echoing feedback and a blistering rhythm section. I left the show feeling overwhelmed and confused.</p>
      <p>The album was released a few months later to critical acclaim. And while the band's well-received transformation did nothing to immediately quell my preference for Dylan Baldi's earlier, poppier sound, I became more and more comfortable with <i>Attack on Memory</i>'s full-band intensity, the newfound darknesss and attention to space, which is best demonstrated by album-opener "No Future/No Past" but present throughout. In other tracks like "Fall In," "Stay Useless," and "Our Plans," Baldi's penchant for vocal hooks and brilliant lead guitar remains on full display. More than just about any other new music I was listening to in high school, Cloud Nothings and this album have stood the test of time.</p>

    <div class='blurb'>
      <h1>Angel Olsen, <i>MY WOMAN</i></h1>
      <h2>2014</h2>
      <p>It's hard to imagine an album that sounds as effortlessly cool as <i>MY WOMAN</i>. In fact, it's hard to imagine an album that sounds anything like <i>MY WOMAN</i>, despite the Johnny Cash-cum-Stevie Nick tinged vocal melodies and guitar. Ultimately, Olsen's influences never feel overstated and their combination is distinctly hers: never too country, but the drift is there; never too classic rock, but the rough-edged guitar solos are there; always covering a full dynamic range and consistent as hell, but never repetitive. Every song on this album shines, but "Sister" is the most skyward of all.</p>

  <div class='album'> 
    <img src='images/Iceage-Plowing_Into_the_Field_of_Love.jpg'/>
    <div class='blurb'>
      <h1>Iceage, <i>Plowing Into the Field of Love</i></h1>
      <h2>2014</h2>
      <p>Iceage's first three albums, released between 2011 and 2014, depict the stunning evolution of a band that was hailed as the saviour of punk rock when its members were just 17 years old. And while the band's range of musical influences, tempos, and instrumentation broadened, frontman Elias Ronnenfelt's stunning lyricism and inimitable howl only deepened. Iceage has always cared about the details — deceptively complex song structures and unexpected interludes have been present in their work since debut album <i>New Brigade</i> — but <i>Plowing Into the Field of Love</i> establishes them as one of the most dynamic bands of the decade, as well.</p>

    <div class='blurb'>
      <h1>Kelela, <i>Take Me Apart</i></h1>
      <h2>2017</h2>
      <p>In <i>Take Me Apart</i>, Kelela establishes herself as nothing less than a worldbuilder. The album is a captivating experience that centers on three stages of post-relationship reckoning and recovery, sometimes flirtatious and at other times emotionally raw. Kelela's songwriting and seemingly effortless croon are center stage, uplifted by lush, retro-futuristic production throughout. It is served with an indeterminate sheen that would feel equally at home in the world of Bladerunner or Berlin, but its surface quality does not betray an album that is nonetheless deeply human.</p>

      <div class='blurb'>
        <h1>Kelly Moran, <i>Ultraviolet</i></h1>
        <h2>2018</h2>
        <p>There are very few situations that do not go well with listening to <i>Ultraviolet</i>. The album is classical enough to aid focus, ambient enough to unwind to after a long day, and expressive enough to draw tears from sensitive listeners. Its potency confirms that Kelly Moran is not only an outstanding pianist, but also a quietly innovative producer.</p>

        <p>Among the most striking elements of Moran's approach is the sound of prepared piano: its toy-like and seemingly weightless timbre pairs beautifully with her iterative and melodic style of improvisation. (The technique of prepared piano, which involves placing objects between the piano strings to achieve a persistent dampening buzz, was pioneered by John Cage, but dare-I-say perfected by Moran.) Much more subtly, Moran's playing is supplemented by waves of a fog-like synth on tracks like "Autowave" and "Nereid" to enrapturing effect. A cohesive and utterly gorgeous album through-and-through, every listen to <i>Ultraviolet</i> brings new appreciation.</p>

    <div class='blurb'>
      <h1>Charli XCX, <i>Pop 2</i></h1>
      <h2>2017</h2>
      <p><i>Pop 2</i> is an enigma, simultaneously one of the edgiest pop releases of the decade and one of the most surface-obsessed. It is a cult classic from Taylor Swift's U.S. tour opener, and every song is a blast. Despite featuring an all-star roster of featured artists like Carly Rae Jepsen, Caroline Polachek, Kim Petras, and Jay Park, Charli XCX and executive producer A.G. Cook rarely stray from the center of attention: their vision is innovative, focused, and fun. Not that elements like Polachek's outro on "Tears" and Park's verse on "Unlock It" don't bring the album to a new level – they do – but they exist in Charli's universe.</p>
