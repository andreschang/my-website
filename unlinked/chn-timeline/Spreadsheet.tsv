1	Initiation of GISP2 Ice Core Drilling	1988	1993	1988 - 1993	1	1	The second Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP2) ice core, which is featured in 88 Cores, provides a highly detailed and accurate record of climate over the last 110,000 years. Like rings of a tree, ice core layers correspond to different years in Earth’s history. Scientists can analyze ice properties like grain size and gas concentration to explore past climate conditions including air temperature, pollution, and snowfall. Drilling in central Greenland for GISP2 was initiated in 1988 and was completed five years later in 1993.<span id ='dEnd1'></span>	Ice cores are an invaluable resource that allow scientists to determine past climate conditions like air temperature and snowfall.<span id ='qEnd1'></span>	Ice cores are an invaluable resource that allow scientists to determine past climate conditions like air temperature and snowfall.<span id ='qEnd1'></span>	<p>NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, <a target='_blank' href='ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/icecore/greenland/summit/gisp2/depthage/gisp2age.txt'>GISP2 Meese/Sowers Timescale</a></p>	GISP2 Drill Dome	© Paul Mayewski	gisp2_crop.jpg	331	574	Andres Chang	research assistant	Institute at Brown for Environment and Society
2	Pytheas reaches Far North	-330	0	330 BCE - 0	-535	-0.33243295	Around 330 BCE, the Greek geographer Pytheas embarked on a voyage that would take him to the Arctic Circle – nearly 2000 miles from his home in Marseille. Pytheas was the first to describe Arctic phenomena like the midnight sun, the aurora, and floating sea ice in writing, and he used novel measurement tools to precisely record latitude and tidal variability. Pytheas named the landmass he reached (likely present-day Iceland or Norway) ‘Thule,’ meaning the land beyond all known lands. His momentous volume, On the Ocean, remained the only first-hand account of its kind for centuries, widely referred to by scholars in Ancient Greece as a feat of science and exploration. It has now been lost.<span id ='dEnd2'></span>	Pytheas was the first to describe Arctic phenomena like the midnight sun, the aurora, and floating sea ice in writing.<span id ='qEnd2'></span>	Pytheas was the first to describe Arctic phenomena like the midnight sun, the aurora, and floating sea ice in writing.<span id ='qEnd2'></span>	<p>CNN, <a target='_blank' href='link2.com'>Title 2</a></p><p>New York Times, <a target='_blank' href='link1.com'>Title 1</a></p>	Gerard Mercator's map of the Arctic, 1595	Credit: Helmink Antique Maps	hyperborea.jpg	720	668	Andres Chang	research assistant	Institute at Brown for Environment and Society
