  <img src ='images/portrait.jpg'/ style = 'width:200px;'><p>Andres is an artist and researcher whose work probes the ever-present negotiation between humans and natural systems. He employs computation, drawing, construction, and digital media to produce work from a interdisciplinary perspective. Climate change is a common thread, and Andres alternately designs projects that respond intimately to environmental conditions and as speculative replacements for a dying planet.</p>
  <p>Currently an intern with the Science Based Targets initative at CDP and an assistant to the conceptual artist Paolo Cirio. Formerly at the Climate Museum and the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. In 2017, he earned an Sc.B. from Brown University.</p>
