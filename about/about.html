  <img src ='images/portrait.jpg'/ style = 'width:200px;'><p>Andres is an artist and researcher whose work probes the ever-present negotiation between humans and natural systems. He employs computation, drawing, construction, and digital media to produce work from an interdisciplinary perspective. Climate change is a common thread, and Andres alternately designs projects that respond intimately to environmental conditions and as speculative replacements for a dying planet.</p>
  <p>As a data analyst at CDP, Andres supports the development of system-scale emissions reduction strategies and environmental disclosure. He is also an upcoming artist in resident at Caldera Arts Center (2019). Formerly, Andres has worked as a researcher with the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society and as an assistant to the conceptual artist Paolo Cirio.</p>
