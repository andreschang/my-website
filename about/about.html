  <p>Andres is an artist and researcher who investigates the emergence of worlds in a time of ecological collapse. By working with a diverse range of media and participatory gestures, he advances a shared approach to the production of environmental knowledge. At their core, Andresâ€™s recent projects question the narrative cohesion of how we understand the past or future: piecing together historical artifacts, familial memories, and scientific research tools in a form of speculative performance.</p>
  <p>As a senior technical officer at CDP, Andres supports the development and implementation of global emissions reduction strategies. He is a recent artist-in-resident at <a href="https://calderaarts.org/caldera/arts-in-residence/" target="_blank">Caldera</a> and participant in <a href="https://crit.nyc/" target="_blank">Crit</a>. Formerly, Andres has worked as a researcher with the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society and as an assistant to the conceptual artist Paolo Cirio.</p>
