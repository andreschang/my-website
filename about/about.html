  <p>Andres is an artist and researcher who investigates the emergence of worlds in a time of ecological collapse. By working with a diverse range of media and participatory gestures, he advances a shared approach to the production of environmental knowledge. At their core, Andres’s recent projects question the narrative cohesion of how we understand the past or future: piecing together historical artifacts, familial memories, and scientific research tools.</p>
  <p>Andres’s mixed media projects have been exhibitioned at GroundWork Gallery (King’s Lynn, UK), Assembly Room (New York, NY), Brown Univeristy (Providence, RI), and elsewhere. Andres has a background in earth system modeling and spent more than four years working at an influential, UN-backed climate program. During that time, he was also an artist-in-residence at Caldera Arts and became involved with the grassroots activist network Science for the People. Andres was an assistant to the conceptual artist Paolo Cirio and a member of the multi-disiplinary cooperative Soft Surplus. He now lives in Brooklyn and is a senior researcher at Greenpeace USA.</p>
