<h2>About this site</h2>
<p>This site primarily documents my intermittent creative practice. However, I have updated this section to reflect my primary occupation with sustainability research and practice.</p>
  <h2>Research statement</h2>
<p>My research interests are broad but generally involve energy transitions, extractivism, and  transnational sustainability initiatives. I take seriously the distinct goals, accountability relationships, and enforcement capabilities available to public and private actors, and the interactions between them that shape governance. With a preference for quantitative and mixed methodologies, I aspire to conduct research that improves understanding of (1) the shape and evolution of multi-actor climate and critical minerals governance spheres and (2) the social and environmental outcomes they are linked to &quot;on the ground.&quot; Although the scope of these issues is global, I am developing a specific interest in extractive industries in Peru.</p>
<h2>Professional background</h2>
<p>Between 2018 and 2022, I worked on the technical team of the Science Based Targets initiative, a pioneering standard-setter and validator of corporate climate targets. Due partly to my undergraduate training in the physical sciences, my assignments typically involved the &quot;translation&quot; of global goals into cross-sector frameworks. Working closely with the initiative&#39;s executive body and scientific advisors, I led technical aspects of key projects such as the Corporate Net-Zero Standard (V1.0) and became the initiative&#39;s first Research Manager.</p>
<p>I changed paths in 2022 when I accepted a Senior Research Specialist position at Greenpeace USA. Within my new role, I carried out research supportive of campaigns to halt the build-out of U.S. liquefied natural gas infrastructure and defend the right to protest from corporate-funded attacks. The dynamic nature of advocacy, as well as the breadth of social and environmental issues confronted by Greenpeace, meant that I tracked a broad range of issues from the local to the global scale. My projects varied but typically involved a focus on environmental justice, political analysis, corporate research, and/or quantifying emissions.</p>
<p>Currently I am pursuing a Master of Environment and Sustainability at the University of Toronto.</p>
