<h1>Business as Usual: 1967-2067</h1>
        <h2>Projection, proximity sensor. 2018.</h2>

        <p>In 1967, Syukuro Manabe and Richard T. Wetherald published a research paper that would become the basis for the modern climate model. Based on their calculations, which were the first to accurately describe surface cooling by atmospheric processes, they concluded that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide would produce about 2&deg;C of warming. Their estimate is still considered accurate. </p>
        <p><i>Business as Usual: 1967-2067</i> is a projection of surface temperature calculated from CESM &ndash; a modern climate simulation. By default, the projection shows "control run" data (i.e. no human forcing), but when a person gets close, it switches to a "business as usual" scenario.</p>
