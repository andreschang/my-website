        <p>chaos.17.01 is a contour map of surface temperature across the biblical conception of chaos. The climate of chaos was precisely determined by means of a general circulation model (GCM), where the surface of the planet has been made randomly reflective/absorptive, run for nine years on a supercomputer at Brown CCV. A "slice" of the climate of chaos is extracted from output data, printed on glass, and presented atop a light table.</p>
