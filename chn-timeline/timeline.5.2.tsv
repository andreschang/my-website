0	1	Continued Greenland ice loss	2010	2017	1	1	If fully melted, the Greenland ice sheet would raise global sea level by about 20 feet. Scientists agree that human-induced climate change is accelerating Greenland ice loss, which carries major implications for coastal regions across the world. Still, a complex array of feedback systems that contribute to ice loss remain incompletely understood, making it difficult to accurately predict future melt rates. Based on analyses of satellite data and direct observations, scientists estimate that nearly 4000 billion metric tons of ice have been lost from Greenland since 2002 – almost enough to fill Lake Michigan – but the rate of ice loss could increase dramatically if we don’t take action to fight climate change.

2	3	Initiation of GISP2 Ice Core Drilling	1988	1993	0	0	The second Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP2) ice core, which is featured in <i>88 Cores</i>, provides a highly detailed and accurate record of climate over the last 110,000 years. Like rings of a tree, ice core layers correspond to different years in Earth’s history. Scientists can analyze ice properties like grain size and gas concentration to explore past climate conditions including air temperature, pollution, and snowfall. Drilling in central Greenland for GISP2 was initiated in 1988 and was completed five years later in 1993.

Their claims are disputed, as neither produced sufficient evidence to verify his location at precisely 90˚N. To this day, the identity of the first person to stand at the North Pole remains unclear.</p> <p>Any attempt to reach the North Pole is impeded by the fact that, unlike the South Pole, it is uncovered by landmass. Instead, the North Pole is located on drifting sea ice, constantly in motion. Despite our cultural fascination with it, the North Pole can be understood in essence as a fabrication of geometry. As one early explorer wrote, “the pole was ascertained to be the intersection of lines in a point, of which nothing was to be seen in reality.”</p>	Relying heavily on Inuit guides, American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E.

0	5	Widespread Greenland ice melt event	1889	1894	-40.53	-0.025	By studying the layers of a Greenland ice core, scientists determined that the Greenland ice sheet experienced an extreme amount of surface melting in 1889. They identified a layer in the core from that year with nearly bubble-free ice – a signature of snow that melted and later refroze. In addition, they found evidence for a possible cause of the melt event: a high concentration of black carbon, which decreases the reflectivity of ice and was probably the result of forest fires raging across Europe at the time. Similar conditions were identified in ice core layers from 2012, the worst melt year on record. Climate change is known to increase the frequency of both warm weather and forest fires, which contributed to these melt events.

In 1859, Church embarked on an expedition to the North Atlantic to sketch icebergs; the resulting paintings, first shown in 1861, are highly dramatic and reflect the sense of wonder – perhaps even fear – experienced by Church as he explored these glaciated seascapes.

2	9	Search for the Northwest Passage	1650	1800	-100	-0.062	<p>Particularly influential in the European imagination of the Arctic was the theory of an ice-free polar sea. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the ancient Greek myth of Hyperborea – describing a warm, polar ocean with no ice and eternal sunlight – had reconstructed itself as the scientific hypothesis of the Northwest Passage. Faith in its existence was driven by the search for a commercially lucrative trade route between Western Europe and Asia; the desire to discover it inspired much of early European exploration of coastal North America.</p> <p>More recently, rising temperatures and vanishing polar sea ice suggest that new trade routes will begin to open up across the Arctic, belatedly, and ominously, fulfilling the vision of the Northwest Passage.</p>	Faith in the existence of the Passage was driven in large part by an appetite for a commercially lucrative trade route between Western Europe and Asia<span id ="qEnd9">.</span>	Faith in the existence of the Passage was driven in large part by an appetite for a commercially lucrative trade route between Western Europe and Asia<span id ="qEnd9">.</span>									<p>National Geographic, <a target="_blank" href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/northwest-passage-map-history/">These Maps Show the Epic Quest for a Northwest Passage.</a></p><p>The New York Times, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/03/science/earth/arctic-shipping.html?_r=0">As Arctic Ice Vanishes, New Shipping Routes Open.</a></p>

In Northern Europe, rapid glacial advance destroyed entire villages. Locally, the deeply frozen Hudson River enabled ‘commuting by sleigh’. Writers and artists responded to the Little Ice Age with an explosion of work depicting winter scenes, which were generally romanticized and did not depict the hardships of the lower class.

2	11	Pytheas reaches Far North	-330	0	-535	-0.33	Around 330 BCE, the Greek geographer Pytheas embarked on a voyage that would take him to the Arctic Circle – nearly 2000 miles from his home in Marseille. Pytheas was the first to describe Arctic phenomena like the midnight sun, the aurora, and floating sea ice in writing, and he used novel measurement tools to precisely record latitude and tidal variability. Pytheas named the landmass he reached (likely present-day Iceland or Norway) ‘Thule,’ meaning the land beyond all known lands. His momentous volume, On the Ocean, remained the only first-hand account of its kind for centuries, widely referred to by scholars in Ancient Greece as a feat of science and exploration. It has now been lost.

Appearing first in myth and later in texts by Herodotus, a 5th century BCE historian, the Greeks believed that the lost continent of “Hyperborea” lay beyond the North Wind. Hyperborea, a place free of war and illuminated by eternal sunlight, is perhaps the first example of the western world’s fascination with the Arctic as a place apart – a portal to the unknown. The legend resurfaced in later European cultures, as shown by a 16th century map depicting Hyperborea by famed cartographer Gerard Mercator.</p>	Hyperborea, a land free of war and illuminated by eternal sunlight, is perhaps the first example of the western world’s fascination with the Arctic as a place apart<span id ="qEnd12">.</span>	Hyperborea, a land free of war and illuminated by eternal sunlight, is perhaps the first example of the western world’s fascination with the Arctic as a place apart<span id ="qEnd12">.</span>	Gerard Mercator's map of the Arctic, 1595	Credit: Helmink Antique Maps	hyperborea	720	668	240	160

Genetic evidence suggests that the ancestors of these early Greenlanders came across Canada from Siberia, reaching Greenland over four thousand years ago.</p> <p>The oldest work of art that has been traced back to Arctic inhabitants is a 3700-year old small, ivory maskette. Sculptures like this were often tiny so that they could be carried from place to place by their nomadic owners. This maskette was discovered on Devon Island in the Arctic Archipelago, a mosaic of islands between mainland Canada and Greenland that would have been traversed by early Arctic pioneers.

2	14	Sea level stabilization	-5000	-4000	-1253.07	-0.78	At the dawn of our current interglacial period, ice levels reached a new equilibrium. As melting slowed, sea levels stabilized, as did the coastlines and relatively mild climate that human society has relied on since the beginning of advanced civilization. One of the insights scientists have drawn from studying the Greenland ice sheet is that this period of stability is unusual in the history of Earth's climate over the last 110,000 years. Anthropogenic climate change threatens to throw away the gift of a climate in which we can flourish.

0	15	Younger Dryas	-12500	-9500	-1702	-1.06	<p>During Earth’s slow transition from the Last Glacial Period to today’s warmer interglacial, there was an unexpected departure known as the Younger Dryas. Northern Hemispheric temperatures became much cooler, then slowly began to rise again. The end of the Younger Dryas is marked by a local Greenland warming of 10º C in just 10 years.</p> <p>The cause of this warming is a hotly contested subject. Some researchers believe that the Younger Dryas was caused by a meteor impact and have identified rare metals in Greenland ice cores as evidence, while others believe that it was due to a brief slowdown of Atlantic circulation caused by a pulse of glacial freshwater. In either case, this warming event underscores that Earth's climate has changed considerably, and sometimes abruptly, in the past. A critical difference now is that humans are causing the change.</p>	The end of the Younger Dryas is marked by a local warming of 10º C in just 10 years, which was recorded by oxygen isotopes in Greenland ice GISP2<span id ="qEnd15">.</span>	The end of the Younger Dryas is marked by a local warming of 10º C in just 10 years, which was recorded by oxygen isotopes in Greenland ice GISP2<span id ="qEnd15">.</span>	Map of Northern Hemisphere glacial extent during the Younger Dryas event (12.6 kya)	© Ron Blakey	lgm	1000	966	300	160		<p>Scientific American, <a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/history-of-geology/httpblogsscientificamericancomhistory-of-geology20110727the-younger-dryas-impact-hypothesis/">The Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis</a></p><p>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/abrupt-climate-change/The%20Younger%20Dryas">The Younger Dryas</a></p>
0	16	Last Glacial Maximum	-20000	-18000	-1961	-1.22	For the past 2.6 million years, Earth has regularly cycled between glacial and interglacial periods. Modern climate change is categorically different from Earth’s glacial cycles, which are driven by slow, predictable variations in Earth’s orbit, especially when continental land areas are in the polar regions. Note that these glacial cycles are not the only expression of climatic change over Earth's history, and have been punctuated by more abrupt shifts, as noted above.

The most recent interglacial (not including the present) ended 115 thousand years ago. It is believed that Earth was about 2ºC warmer on average than today’s climate, but as is not the case today, the tropics stayed relatively cool due to weak oceanic circulation.

The decrease of atmospheric CO2 – from around 400 parts per million (ppm) to 200 ppm – is of the same magnitude as the change from preindustrial to modern times, but it occurred over hundreds of thousands of years. This reduction in CO2 and temperature resulted in the formation of a vast ice sheet covering Greenland and adjacent Canada, which had been mainly ice-free for 30 million years. Today, the oldest ice present in the Greenland ice sheet could be more than two million years old.
