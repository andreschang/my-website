<h1>An Arctic Timeline</h1>
<h2>Web application. 2018.</h2>

<p>
  <i>An Arctic Timeline</i> is soon to be launched by <a href = 'https://www.climatemuseum.org/' target='_blank'>the Climate Museum</a> to accompany their first exhibition, <a href = 'https://www.inhumantime.org/' target='_blank'><i>In Human Time</i></a>. The interactive web application presents an overview of climate history, human exploration of the Arctic, and Arctic culture. By scrolling down the "ice core," viewers of <i>An Arctic Timeline</i> are confronted with the profound entanglement of humans and climate &ndash; reflected in part by the artifacts that we produce together.
  </p>

  <p>As project lead, I was responsible for the design, research, writing, production, and web development of <i> An Arctic Timeline</i>. Lisa Goulet and Claudia Villar contributed writing on culture and exploration. Kevin Cadena contributed mobile development.
