<h1>An Arctic Timeline</h1>
<h2>Web application. 2018.</h2>

<p>
  <i>An Arctic Timeline</i> was launched by <a href = 'https://www.climatemuseum.org/' target='_blank'>the Climate Museum</a> to accompany their first exhibition, <a href = 'https://www.inhumantime.org/' target='_blank'><i>In Human Time</i></a>. This interactive web application presents an overview of climate history, human exploration of the Arctic, and Arctic culture. By scrolling down the "ice core," viewers of <i>An Arctic Timeline</i> are confronted with the profound entanglement of humans and climate.
  </p>

  <p>As project lead, I was responsible for most design, research, writing, and web development of <i> An Arctic Timeline</i>. Lisa Goulet, Claudia Villar, and Miranda Massie contributed writing on culture and exploration. Kevin Cadena contributed mobile development.
